            <h1>Dungeons & Dragons</h1>
            <p>
              Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) is a legendary fantasy tabletop
              role-playing game where players create unique characters and
              embark on epic adventures guided by a storyteller called the
              Dungeon Master. Set in magical worlds filled with dragons,
              dungeons, and mythical creatures, players use imagination,
              strategy, and dice rolls to overcome challenges and shape their
              own heroic stories.

          <h2>What is Dungeons & Dragons?</h2>
        </div>

          <div class="whatIsDD__content">
            <p>In Dungeons & Dragons, players form a group of adventurers who explore fantasy worlds while embarking on epic quests and gaining experience. The Dungeon Master (also known as the DM) is both the referee and the storyteller of the game. In D&D, there's no winning or losing, at least not in the conventional sense of the word.</p>
            <p>The foundation of D&D is that it's a story-driven game. The dice only help you move forward. Everything depends on your decisions, from your appearance or your actions to what happens next. <br>
              The collective creativity of a D&D game creates stories you'll tell again and again, from legendary events to absurd incidents that will make you laugh years later. <br>
              Have fun and remember the golden rule: never divide the group!
